# Simple kernel
This project is an experiment in x86 assembly (NASM) and C (gcc)

Building the project with make will generate a very basic x86
operating system image `os-image` which can be booted with qemu

Based on [this
book](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)
